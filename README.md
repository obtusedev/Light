# Light

Prompt I found from reddit.


>>Using Ruby on Rails we would like you to create a simple search tool for health professionals ("Startup Name" Light ðŸ“·). The application should fulfill the requirements below. The source code must be placed in a public repo on GitHub. The  finished application should preferably run in a Docker container, or be deployable on Heroku.

>>- It should be possible to add people (health professionals) to the system by their name
>>- When a person is added, the object is enriched with info from the nationial health professional registry, using our hpr gem*. You decide what data points you find important and/or have time to add.
>>- Each person should have a separate profile page listing their details
>>- One should be able to add people to clinics.
>>- The relationship should be bi-directional, so that it is possible to fetch all associated clinics from a person, and all associated people from a clinic.
>>- Looking at the person's profile, we want to find professionals connected to the same clinic.
>>- The search interface should list all members by name and associated clinics by default
>>- It should be possible to search for professionals by name. Feel free to make other fields searchable as well.
>>- Bonus points: Avoid using Twitter Bootstrap or other CSS framework (we want to see how you structure your CSS)

>>Feel free to use gems and libraries.  We are looking  for a simple, clean and elegant code/layout/design, tests, and all round understanding  of the full stack e.g. Ruby, Rails, CSS (or SASS), HTML,  JavaScript
